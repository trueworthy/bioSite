                    <h3>What did you want to be when you grew up?</h3>
                    <p>
                        When I was young, I wanted to be all the standard things: cop,
                        firefighter, and soldier. However, as I grew up, I got more into
                        motorcycles and now my dream is to run a motorcycle shop for
                        custom built motorcycles.

                    <p>
                        I was a good student, and I was picked on for it. I kept to myself
                        until I got to high school where I finally found a group of
                        friends I fit in with.

                        Yes, I do have a nickname, Cyclops. I got it from my stepfather
                        after I lost my right eye and it just kind of stuck with everyone
                        since.

                        These plants remove impurities from natural gas to make it
                        suitable for use.

                <!-- <p>My name is Jacob Haselton, and I was born in Denver, Colorado, though I've spent some time living
                    away before returning here. I’m the youngest of five siblings, with two older brothers and two older
                    sisters. I graduated from the University of Reno, Nevada, with a degree in mechanical engineering,
                    and for the past four years, I’ve been working at ZAP Engineering & Construction Services. In my
                    role, I help design gas processing plants and booster compressor stations that remove impurities
                    from natural gas.
                </p>
                <p>When I was younger, I dreamed of becoming a cop, firefighter, or soldier. However, as I grew older,
                    my love for motorcycles took over, and now I dream of running a custom motorcycle shop one day. I’ve
                    always been the quiet, good student, but I found my group of friends in high school, and that really
                    helped shape me. I also got my nickname, "Cyclops," from my stepfather after I lost my right eye. It
                    stuck, and now everyone calls me that.
                </p>
                <p>My wife, whom I married in October after being together for almost 10 years, is the person who makes
                    me laugh the most. She’s got a sense of humor that always gets me. I’m motivated by my desire to
                    provide a better life for her and for us as a family. Growing up in a low-income family, I’m driven
                    to create something better for our future, and I’m working hard to make that dream a reality.
                    I look forward to achieving the American dream—owning a house with land, raising a happy family, and
                    enjoying life’s experiences together.
