                    <h3>What did you want to be when you grew up?</h3>
                    <p>
                        When I was young, I wanted to be all the standard things: cop,
                        firefighter, and soldier. However, as I grew up, I got more into
                        motorcycles and now my dream is to run a motorcycle shop for
                        custom built motorcycles.

                        I was a good student, and I was picked on for it. I kept to myself
                        until I got to high school where I finally found a group of
                        friends I fit in with.

                        Yes, I do have a nickname, Cyclops. I got it from my stepfather
                        after I lost my right eye and it just kind of stuck with everyone
                        since.

                        My wife makes me laugh the most. She just has a sense of humor
                        that kills me.

                        One of my favorite memories of my wife is from our wedding
                        ceremony. In the middle of it, she kissed me because she missed
                        me, even though it wasn’t the traditional thing to do.

                        I work as a consultant in the oil and gas industry, helping to
                        design gas processing plants and booster compressor stations.
                        These plants remove impurities from natural gas to make it
                        suitable for use.
