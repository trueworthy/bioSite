                <h2>Graduating College</h2>
                <p>
                    Graduating college was important because it provided me with the knowledge and skills to build a
                    successful career and create a better life for my family, helping me grow both personally and
                    professionally.

                <h2>Career</h2>
                <p>
                    For the past four years, I’ve been working at <a href="https://www.zapecs.com/" target="_blank"
                        id="ZAP"> ZAP
                        Engineering & Construction Services</a>, where I
                    assist in designing gas processing plants and booster compressor stations that eliminate impurities
                    from natural gas, and I’m proud of the role I play in creating systems that contribute to cleaner,
                    more efficient energy solutions.

                <h2>Marriage</h2>
                <p>
                    For the past 10 years, I’ve been with my wife, whom I married in October, and our relationship has
                    been a constant source of support and laughter. Marriage was important to me because it represents a
                    deep commitment to building a life together, and I love how sarcastic she is—it’s one of the things
                    that always keeps me entertained and reminds me why I’m lucky to have her by my side.
